Matrix Operations Tool


What this project does

This tool takes two matrices from the user and performs basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation. 
It uses NumPy library and gives all the outputs in a clear structured format directly in the terminal.


How I made this

I used simple Python without functions. Everything is written in the main flow. 
The NumPy library is used for matrix operations. Input is taken from user directly. 
I kept the variable names short and spaced the code in a way that is easy to read and follow.


How to run this

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

2. Install the required library by running this command:
   pip install numpy

3. Open terminal or command prompt in the folder where this script is located.

4. Run the script using:
   python matrix_tool.py
