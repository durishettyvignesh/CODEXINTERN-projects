🔢 Matrix Operations
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Transpose
5. Determinant
6. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter size of Matrix A (rows cols): 2 2
Enter 2 rows (space-separated values):
1 2
3 4

Enter size of Matrix B (rows cols): 2 2
Enter 2 rows (space-separated values):
5 6
7 8

A + B:
[[ 6.  8.]
 [10. 12.]]
```

## 📘 Notes

- The program handles input validation and matrix shape mismatches.
- Determinant is only computed for square matrices.
